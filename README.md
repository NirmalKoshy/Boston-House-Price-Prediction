# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
This project predicts Boston house prices using a dataset with features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and neighborhoods. We apply machine learning techniques to create a model that estimates prices based on these factors, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed housing market decisions.
